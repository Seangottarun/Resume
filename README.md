# Engineering Resume (Nice Version)

I recently found a nice LaTeX CV template by [Chandan Singh](https://csinva.github.io/) and decided to modify it to suit my needs. The original version is more research focused, so I ended up converting it into a resume style document and modified it to fit under a 1 page limit. 

## Main Files
1. `main.tex`: designs the top header
2. `page1.tex`: designs the left column, experience, projects, and awards sections
3. `style.cls`: various styling configurations
4. `main.pdf`: my resume in PDF format

## Compiling Instructions
To compile the LaTeX to PDF:

```console
xelatex main.tex
```

## Main Changes from Original Version
1. Changed from CV format to resume format
2. Converted to 1 page structure
3. Darkened font colouring
4. Cut publication and research sections
5. Modified header to include personal website link
